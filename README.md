# 30DaysJsVue
30 Day JS Coding Challenge

30 days Javascript challenge is created by Wes Bos, you can find the challenge [here](https://javascript30.com/).

## Rules 

- Build 30 things in 30 days
- No Compiler
- No Libraries
- No Boilerplate
- ~~No Frameworks~~ I'll be using Vue 
- No coding along, just watch the intro and build it

So I want to build some nice projects to get some more experience with Vue and thought this was a nice place to start.
